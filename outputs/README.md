This is where all the outputs from the code get saved.

Have three distinct folders

1. CSV files from score and time outputs
2. Pickle files that were saved during the code to not have to re-run everything when metrics are needed
3. PNG files which are where the plots from the code are saved (these are not saved automatically, and are saved through the Jupyter notebook interface)
